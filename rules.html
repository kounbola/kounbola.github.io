        <p>Welcome to <strong>Koun Bola?</strong>, the fun Bollywood game where you test your knowledge of famous movie dialogues, characters, and actors!</p>
        
        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Players form two teams and take turns answering questions related to Bollywood movies. Each team should have atleast 2 players.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On each turn, one player will be choson and when they start they are shown a random Bollywood movie detail i.e.: <strong>Movie</strong>, <strong>Actor</strong>, and <strong>Character</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Each category has points associated with it: 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Movie:</strong> +1 point</li>
                    <li><strong>Actor:</strong> +2 points</li>
                    <li><strong>Character:</strong> +3 points</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> The random player selected each round will say 1 dialogue associated to the categories within the time limit. If their team guesses the names correctly, they earn the points shown for that category.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once your teammate yells out the answer, the category is clicked, points will be allocated and player can choose to go to the next movie or get more points by saying more dialogues to your teammates recognizing other details. If clicked again, no points will be awarded which can be used to fix mistakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The game continues with alternating turns between the teams. The first team to reach 20 points wins!</li>
